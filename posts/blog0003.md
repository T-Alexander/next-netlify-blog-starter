## DIY Industrial Style Side Tables
One of the simplest pieces of industrial furniture to construct is the small side-table. Usually created from a basic metal frame in the shape of a cube, only beginner level welding skills and limited DIY equipment is needed for construction. A small wooden table top can either be fixed to the top of the frame, or embedded flush within the frame for a more sophisticated appearance.

## Industrial Coffee Tables
Industrial style coffee tables are very similar in construction to industrial side tables. One common feature is a secondary shelf below the table top used for storing books and magazines. These are a fantastic choice for a second DIY furniture project after building a side table since very similar construction techniques are used, albeit on a larger scale.

## Industrial Style Magazine racks
These versatile pieces pair extremely well with an industrial coffee table, particularly when the same materials are used. Being small, these are not cumbersome to build, but due to the angles required for the sides they require slightly more welding and woodworking skill to create than the side table and coffee table.
