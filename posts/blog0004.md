## Leave the millscale on
For an ultra industrial look, the millscale (the black stuff that your raw steel will be coated with) can be left on. This hard-wearing finish is completely matt, and will make your industrial style furniture look like it has come straight from a factory. The main drawback of this approach is the millscale will leave marks on everything, and once worn off would eventually need to be re-coated using one of the below techniques.

## Wax
A great moisture barrier, wax will prevent rust and can be easily re-applied when worn. The finish can be anything from medium matt to deep shine, depending on how much it is buffed. Wax is easy to apply to furniture, can be used on wood and metal parts, and often smells great (although a suitable face-mask must be warn according to the instructions on the tin).
